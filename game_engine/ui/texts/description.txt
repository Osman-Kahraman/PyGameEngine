PyGameEngine is a custom game engine built in Python, focusing 
on modularity, reusability, and clean architectural design. 
And I want to suffer in PyGame... It provides a structured 
foundation for developing 2D games while keeping core engine 
logic separate from gameplay rules.

This repository also serves as a long-term reference for game 
engine design decisions and performance considerations in Python.
